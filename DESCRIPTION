Description: 
    Daily netcdf from e.g. regional climate models (RCM) are not trivial
    to work with. This package, which relies on data.table, makes it easier
    to deal with large data from RCMs, such as from EURO-CORDEX. It has functions
    to extract single grid cells from rotated pole netcdf's as well as the whole 
    array in long format. Can handle non-standard calendars (360, noleap).
